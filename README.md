## Technology used
- NextJs - Framework for ReactJs
- ReactJs
- axios
- Typescript
- Cypress - Unit Testing Framework
- TailwindCSS - CSS Framework

## Note:
- Due to lack of API clarification through the API doc, I have created my own mock API and used in this project.
- I just want to show that I can integrate any API in react.
- I have used cypress unit testing framework. I never used before, this is my first time for using this testing framework. I used it here because I want to show that I can learn any framework even if I don't know it.
- I choose Tailwind CSS as a CSS Framework because it gives me flexibility to write CSS by my ownself, I can create my own components and also it is very light weight and easy to use.
